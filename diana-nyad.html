            <h2>The Dream That Wouldn't Die</h2>

            <p class="lead">September 2, 2013. After 53 hours of non-stop swimming, 64-year-old Diana Nyad stumbled onto the beach in Key West, Florida. She had just swum 110 miles from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage. And she had done something no one had ever done before.</p>

            <p>"Never, ever give up," she gasped into the cameras. Those were her first words after completing the impossible.</p>

            <p>But this wasn't Diana's first attempt. It was her <span class="highlight">fifth</span>.</p>

            <p>She had first tried the Cuba-to-Florida swim in 1978 at age 28. She failed due to weather and currents. For 30 years, she lived with that failure. And at age 60, she decided to try again.</p>

            <p>In 2011, she failed again—jellyfish stings and asthma attacks forced her to quit. In 2012, she tried three more times. Each attempt ended in failure—storms, hypothermia, jellyfish swarms.</p>

            <p>Most people would have given up. But Diana Nyad wasn't most people.</p>

            <p>"I'm not a quitter," she said. "I'll keep trying until I die or I succeed."</p>

            <p>On her fifth attempt, at age 64, she finally made it. She became the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage. And she became a symbol of perseverance, determination, and refusing to accept limitations.</p>

            <h2>The Dangers of the Swim</h2>

            <p class="lead">Swimming from Cuba to Florida isn't just difficult—it's deadly. The 110-mile stretch of ocean is filled with dangers: deadly jellyfish, sharks, unpredictable currents, extreme weather, and hypothermia.</p>

            <p>Diana faced all of them. She was stung by jellyfish so many times her face swelled. She swam through the night in complete darkness. She battled hallucinations from exhaustion. She vomited from swallowing seawater.</p>

            <p>But she kept swimming. Stroke after stroke. Hour after hour. For 53 hours straight.</p>

            <p>When she finally reached Florida, her lips were swollen, her face was blistered, and she could barely stand. But she had done it.</p>

            <h2>Never Too Old to Dream</h2>

            <p class="lead">Diana Nyad's Cuba swim made her a global sensation. She appeared on talk shows, gave TED Talks, and wrote bestselling books. But her real message was simple: you're never too old to chase your dreams.</p>

            <p>"People think life is over at 60," Diana said. "I proved them wrong. I did the greatest thing of my life at 64. Your best years might still be ahead of you."</p>

            <p>Diana's story inspired millions—particularly older adults who felt like their best days were behind them. She showed that age is just a number. That determination matters more than youth. That giving up is the only real failure.</p>
