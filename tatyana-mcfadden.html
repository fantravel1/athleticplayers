            <p class="story-text lead">
                In a cold, understaffed orphanage in St. Petersburg, Russia, a little girl born with spina bifida was learning to move through the world in the only way she could: on her hands.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Tatyana McFadden was born on April 21, 1989, with a severe form of spina bifida—a neural tube defect that left her paralyzed from the waist down. Her biological mother, unable to care for a disabled child in post-Soviet Russia, left her at the orphanage shortly after birth.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                The orphanage was ill-equipped for a child with disabilities. <span class="highlight">There was no wheelchair, no physical therapy, no accommodations</span>. The other children walked. Tatyana wanted to move too. So she adapted. She taught herself to walk on her hands.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                For the first six years of her life, this was how Tatyana navigated the world—hand over hand, pulling her paralyzed legs behind her, building incredible upper body strength that would one day make her a champion. She'd race the other children down the hallways, her small hands slapping against the cold floor, her spirit unbreakable despite circumstances that would have crushed most adults.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                "I didn't know I was supposed to feel limited," Tatyana says now. "I just knew I wanted to keep up with everyone else, and walking on my hands was how I did it."
            </p>
        </section>

            <p class="story-text">
                In 1994, Deborah McFadden, a commissioner with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, traveled to Russia on business. During her visit, she toured the orphanage where Tatyana lived. When she saw this six-year-old girl racing around on her hands, smiling despite everything, Deborah's heart broke—and then made a decision.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                "I saw this little girl who was so full of life, so determined," Deborah recalled. "I knew I had to bring her home."
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                The adoption process took months of paperwork, international red tape, and countless bureaucratic hurdles. But in 1994, <span class="highlight">Tatyana McFadden arrived in the United States</span>, meeting her new mother at the airport, seeing her first wheelchair—a symbol not of limitation, but of freedom.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                "When I got that wheelchair, it changed everything," Tatyana remembers. "Suddenly I could go faster, farther. I could really fly."
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Deborah enrolled Tatyana in physical therapy, ensuring she received the medical care and support she'd never had in Russia. She also enrolled her in sports—swimming, basketball, track and field. Whatever Tatyana wanted to try, Deborah encouraged. Whatever barrier stood in their way, they broke through together.

            <p class="story-text">
                At Atholton High School in Maryland, Tatyana excelled in wheelchair racing. She won medals, broke records, dominated her events. But there was one problem: <span class="highlight">she wasn't allowed to earn varsity letters or score points for her school</span> because she competed in a wheelchair, not on her feet.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                The school claimed allowing wheelchair athletes to letter would give them an "unfair advantage." The irony was cruel—a girl born with paralysis, who'd spent her earliest years in an orphanage walking on her hands, was being told she had an unfair advantage.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Tatyana and her mother sued. The case went all the way to the Maryland legislature, where 15-year-old Tatyana testified with poise and power, explaining that she just wanted to be treated like any other athlete, to be recognized for her hard work and achievements.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                In 2008, Maryland passed "Tatyana's Law," requiring schools to allow students with disabilities to compete for varsity letters and team recognition. The law has since been adopted in other states, <span class="highlight">opening doors for thousands of disabled student-athletes</span> who came after her.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                "I didn't fight for myself," Tatyana explains. "I fought for the girl who comes after me, who deserves to have her hard work recognized, who deserves to know she belongs on that team."

                Tatyana's first Paralympic Games came in 2004 in Athens, when she was just 15 years old. She won silver and bronze medals, announcing herself to the world. But it was just the beginning.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                At the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, she won three silver and one bronze. London 2012: four golds. Rio 2016: six medals including four golds. Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021): two more medals, bringing her Paralympic total to 20.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                But Tatyana doesn't just compete in track events. She's conquered marathon racing in a way few athletes have in any category. <span class="highlight">She's the only person—wheelchair or otherwise—to win all four major marathons (Boston, Chicago, London, New York) in the same year</span>, a feat she accomplished not once but twice (2013 and 2021).

            <p class="story-text">
                To understand Tatyana's marathon achievements, you need to understand the marathon "Grand Slam"—winning Boston, Chicago, London, and New York in the same calendar year. In the non-wheelchair division, no one has ever done it. The logistics alone make it nearly impossible: the races are weeks apart, requiring peak performance four times in a single season.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                In 2013, Tatyana did it. She won all four, in dominant fashion, never finishing more than a minute behind her own record pace. The sports world was stunned. This was a once-in-a-lifetime achievement.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Then in 2021, she did it again. At 32 years old, coming back from injury and the pandemic, Tatyana swept the marathon majors for a second time, proving that the first wasn't luck or timing—it was greatness.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                "People asked if I could do it again," she says with a smile. "I answered with my wheels, not my words."
